# DataSimulator.ai

**DataSimulator.ai** is an AI-powered career simulator designed to bridge the gap between theoretical tutorials and real-world data science work. It generates realistic, production-grade projects—ranging from basic SQL analytics to complex MLOps pipelines—complete with messy datasets, ambiguous stakeholder emails, and production constraints.

## 🚀 What It Does

Most learners get stuck in "Tutorial Hell"—following clean, step-by-step videos that don't reflect the chaos of an actual job. DataSimulator.ai solves this by simulating the **environment** of a real Data Scientist or Engineer.

### Key Features

*   **🏢 Company-Specific Roadmaps**: Choose a target industry (e.g., Fintech at Paytm, Streaming at Netflix, Ride-sharing at Uber) and get a tailored 19-project career roadmap generated by AI.
*   **🧠 Realistic Simulations**:
    *   **Stakeholder Ambiguity**: Tasks arrive as vague emails from Product Managers, not clean textbook problem statements.
    *   **Dirty Data**: The AI generates realistic CSV and SQL files with nulls, duplicates, and weird formats that you must actually clean.
    *   **Visual Assets**: Uses **Gemini 2.5 Flash Image** to generate dashboard mockups and project thumbnails (16:9 3D tech illustrations).
*   **🔄 Infinite Progression**:
    *   **Follow-up Tasks**: Click "Create Follow-up" to generate a sequel project based on your previous work (e.g., "Now deploy that model you just built").
    *   **Difficulty Scaling**: Manually generate new "Easy", "Medium", or "Hard" tasks to fill your board.
*   **🏆 Gamification**: Earn XP, unlock badges (like "First Blood" or "100% Club"), maintain daily streaks, and track your submission activity via a GitHub-style heatmap.
*   **🛠️ Tech Stack Simulation**: Provides downloadable `docker-compose.yml` and `init.sql` files to help users set up local production environments tailored to the specific company stack.

## 🤖 How It Works

The application leverages the **Google Gemini API** (`gemini-2.5-flash` and `gemini-2.5-flash-image`) to dynamically hallucinate entire corporate environments.

1.  **Context Injection**: We feed the model specific company profiles (industry, typical problems).
2.  **Structured Generation**: The AI returns strictly typed JSON data for tasks, ensuring the UI remains stable while the content remains dynamic.
3.  **Asset Creation**: When a user opens a task, the AI generates the specific "files" (data tables, images) on the fly, making every simulation unique.
